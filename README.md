### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the creator of **xoid** ([repo](https://github.com/onurkerimov/onurkerimov) / [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website](https://xoid.dev)), a framework-agnostic state management library. It aims to unify global state, local component state, and finite state machines in a single API.
