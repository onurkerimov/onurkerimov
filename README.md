## Hi there, I'm Onur Kerimov 👋

I like designing APIs that care for developer experience and human productivity.

I'm the creator of [**xoid**](https://github.com/onurkerimov/xoid) ( [repo ↗︎](https://github.com/onurkerimov/xoid) / [npm ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website ↗︎](https://xoid.dev) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It aims to make atomic state management approachable for teams. Aside to being minimal, it aims unify global state, local component state, and finite state machines in a single API. React has a special place in the project's spirit. Even though it's framework-agnostic, **xoid**'s secondary aim is bringing particularly to React the good foundations of true reactivity.
