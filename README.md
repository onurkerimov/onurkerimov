## Hi there, I'm Onur Kerimov ðŸ‘‹

I like designing APIs with high levels of ergonomics, reuse, and extensibility. 

I care for developer experience and human productivity.

I'm the creator of [**xoid**](https://github.com/onurkerimov/xoid) ( [repo â†—ï¸Ž](https://github.com/onurkerimov/xoid) / [npm â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website â†—ï¸Ž](https://xoid.dev) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It aims to unify global state, local component state, and finite state machines in a single, easy to learn API. It happens to be my most important manifesto in frontend web programming. React has a special place in the project's spirit. Even though it's framework-agnostic, **xoid**'s secondary aim is bringing particularly to React the good foundations of state management that Svelte or Solid relies on.
