I'm the creator of [**xoid**](https://github.com/xoidlabs/xoid) ( [repo ↗︎](https://github.com/xoidlabs/xoid) / [npm ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website ↗︎](https://xoid.dev) / [community on X ↗︎](https://x.com/i/communities/2014928842004025641) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It unifies global state, local component state, finite state machines, and observable streams in the same API. **xoid**'s secondary aim is bringing particularly to React the modern reactivity patterns.

I'm also building the next generation of developer tools at [**Pacy**](https://pacy.dev). It lets you prompt, inspect, edit, and review your code from your browser. You can make change requests to Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor, simply by clicking elements on your webpage. It seamlessly integrates with majo IDEs, and UI frameworks to supercharge your development workflow.

I love open source and some popular projects I contributed to were [Stitches](https://github.com/stitchesjs/stitches/pull/1051) and [react-date-range](https://github.com/hypeserver/react-date-range/commits?author=onurkerimov). I also open sourced [animate-code](https://github.com/onurkerimov/animate-code), a React component to animate code snippets using PrismJS and `@formkit/auto-animate`. You can see it in action on [xoid website](https://xoid.dev).
