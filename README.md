## Hi there, I'm Onur Kerimov 👋

I like designing APIs that care for developer experience and human productivity.

I'm the creator of [**xoid**](https://github.com/onurkerimov/xoid) ( [repo ↗︎](https://github.com/onurkerimov/xoid) / [npm ↗︎](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website ↗︎](https://xoid.dev) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It aims to make atomic state management approachable. It also happens to unify global state, local component state, finite state machines, and observable streams in a single API. React has a special place in the project's spirit. Even though it's framework-agnostic, **xoid**'s secondary aim is bringing particularly to React the modern reactivity patterns.
