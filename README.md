I like designing APIs that care for developer experience and human productivity.

I'm the creator of [**xoid**](https://github.com/xoidlabs/xoid) ( [repo â†—ï¸Ž](https://github.com/xoidlabs/xoid) / [npm â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website â†—ï¸Ž](https://xoid.dev) / [opencollective â†—ï¸Ž](https://opencollective.com/xoid) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It unifies global state, local component state, finite state machines, and observable streams in a single, easy-to-learn API. React has a special place in the project's spirit. **xoid**'s secondary aim is bringing particularly to React the modern reactivity patterns.
