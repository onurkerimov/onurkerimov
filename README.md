### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like designing APIs with high levels of ergonomics, reuse, and extensibility. 

I care for developer experience and human productivity.

I'm the creator of **xoid** ( [repo â†—ï¸Ž](https://github.com/onurkerimov/onurkerimov) / [npm â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website â†—ï¸Ž](https://xoid.dev) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It happens to be my most important manifesto in frontend web programming. It aims to unify global state, local component state, and finite state machines in a single, easy to learn API. Even though it's framework-agnostic, React has a special place in the project's spirit. Another aim of the project is to bring React, the good foundations of state management that Svelte or Solid is relies on.

My other projects worth mentioning are [boxoid](https://github.com/onurkerimov/boxoid) (a criticism against classical **styled** functions) and [itches](https://github.com/onurkerimov/itches).
