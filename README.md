### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I like designing APIs with high levels of ergonomics, reuse, and extensibility. 

I care for developer experience and human productivity.

I'm the creator of **xoid** ( [repo â†—ï¸Ž](https://github.com/onurkerimov/onurkerimov) / [npm â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website â†—ï¸Ž](https://xoid.dev) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It happens to be my my most important manifesto in frontend programming. It aims to unify global state, local component state, and finite state machines in a single, easy-to-learn API.
