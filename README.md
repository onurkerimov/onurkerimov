I love designing neat APIs that care for developer experience. I love open source and I've contributed to popular open source projects such as [Stitches](https://github.com/stitchesjs/stitches/pull/1051) and [react-date-range](https://github.com/hypeserver/react-date-range/commits?author=onurkerimov).

I'm the creator of [**xoid**](https://github.com/xoidlabs/xoid) ( [repo â†—ï¸Ž](https://github.com/xoidlabs/xoid) / [npm â†—ï¸Ž](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xoid) / [website â†—ï¸Ž](https://xoid.dev) ), a framework-agnostic state management library. It unifies global state, local component state, finite state machines, and observable streams in a single, easy-to-learn API. React has a special place in the project's spirit. **xoid**'s secondary aim is bringing particularly to React the modern reactivity patterns.
